This is my Munggit website.

Using Next.js, I have made a fully functioning blog with posts, categories, and comments, which are all linked.

Everything went extremely well and I learnt a lot. I met all the requirements.

I wanted to have a sort by category option but I could not figure out how to get that to work. There is a remnant of it where you are able to click on the category and it'll take you to a link, but it's the exact same as the main posts page.

I met a lot of bugs before I realised I had to use revalidate("/"), but once I got that in everything went pretty smoothly!
